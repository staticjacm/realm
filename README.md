# Description
A game I have been wanting to make for awhile now. This is the engine, or whatever you want to call it

It uses SGOGL (which uses ~~GLFW~~ SDL2, SDL_mixer, SOIL, and OpenGL + GLAD, and influenced by BearLibTerminal)

It is programmed in D

### Note on file layout structure:
``include/realm`` contains the core functions and classes of the game.

``assets`` also has source files that are associated with individual entities, shots, stationary pieces, worlds, etc
