# To do:

* Find a sound library



# Already done:

* Write agent-agent collision detection loop and test it with a test agent

* Render only whats in the view 

* Agent-wall, agent-ground collisions



# Possible To Dos:

* Agent.size could be an overridable function instead of a variable

* Rooted objects should probably be updated independent of Area - ie: Area's only responsibility should be collision detection

* Collision objects should all be unified

* Collision functions should all have similar names

* There should be some way to get all agents, rooted etc in a region - a way to check overlaps within an arbitrary area of space
