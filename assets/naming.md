## Naming asset classes and modules:
Naming convention is as follows:
* Module names shouldn't be enumerated (not my_module_1, my_module_2, etc)
* Class names should be enumerated always (my_class_1, my_class_2, etc)
If two asset classes are similar they should go into the same module
Modules should go into their own folders along with any modules similar enough to them inside the particular superclass folder they belong
